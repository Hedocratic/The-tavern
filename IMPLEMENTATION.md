# Character Creation System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete character creation system for "The Tavern" RPG game, built in Godot. It addresses the syntax errors mentioned in the issue and implements all the required classes, stats, and skills systems.

## Fixed Syntax Errors

The original character creation script had several syntax errors around line 139:

1. **Line 139**: Missing parameter type, closing parenthesis, and colon in function definition
   - **Fixed**: `func apply_class_specific_setup(class_name: String):`

2. **Line 142**: Unexpected indentation in class body
   - **Fixed**: Proper indentation structure

3. **Line 144**: Unexpected "match" in class body
   - **Fixed**: Proper match statement within function body

4. **Lines 145-146**: Unexpected indents
   - **Fixed**: Consistent indentation for match cases

5. **Line 147**: Unexpected identifier "fortitude_spinbox"
   - **Fixed**: Proper statement structure with null checking
